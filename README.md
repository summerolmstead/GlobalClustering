# GlobalClustering
This was a final project from 2024 Spring for Programming Languages for Data Analytics. This is a clustering data visualization project using data from the world health organization. Me and my partner, Major, did this project together during spring semester of 2024. I am uploading this later (1.6.25) to have this project onto my github!
